A small container project to help me create Sourcery Mocks without the need to add it as dependency in pet projects

# Steps

1.-  Download the app and create a new file or replacing the one that exists with the one you want to us (change the file name as well) 
2.-  Create any dependency like class or struct objects empty, we don't need them completely since they will reside in your project, but we need them as dependecy to create the mock file
3.-  Run the test target
4.- It will create the file on the path `SourceryAppGeneratorTests/Mocks/Generated` 
5.- Paste this file in your project, remember to add the imports needed and that's about it

ðŸŽ‰ enjoy
